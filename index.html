                <p id="desc">Hey, welcome to Good Taste! I’m Rachel Jordan and I made this website in 2018 for the
                Dev Catalyst Competition. The contest required one web portfolio and I was running out of time to
                meet the deadline, so I made this website in a few days. It was barely functional back then, but
                looked alright to be last-minute. Since then, it’s simply made a bad taste in my mouth, so I began
                to compile a list of websites that I actually think are cool and leave a good taste instead. I've
                also included links to some of my older websites as well. Take your time to check out every one!</p>

            <h2>Macbeth Website?</h2>
                    <p>Hey guys, so I was looking around the Internet for some stuff to do for my MGP when I found
                    this weird website. It's some kind of blog, and it seems to have been written by Macbeth himself.
                    Here's a link so you can check it out for yourself.</p>

            <h2>Web Portfolio by Kwok Yin Mak</h2>
                    <p>Found this cool web portfolio made by Kwok Yin Mak. It's really interesting because it uses
                    horizontal scrolling instead of vertical scrolling like most websites.</p>

            <h2>Active Theory Website</h2>
                    <p>This website is very interactive with its moving backgrounds and smooth transitions. The
                    animations make the website look almost like a game, seamlessly moving from one scene to the next.</p>

                    <p>A classmate of mine loved this website for its transitions and formatting. I only just now
                    checked it out and I've found that navigation is very smooth and seamless.</p>
