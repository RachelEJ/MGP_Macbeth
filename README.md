# MGP_Macbeth
My MGP for AP English.

You know, not really sure why I have this specific repository since I have another which is basically the same thing except with another name.
But whatever.
Here's a quick summary, my AP English teacher wanted us to make a multi-genre project, an MGP. I made up a whole scenario of "What if Macbeth had a blog" and went into the posibilities.
The idea is that I run a blog on a terrible-looking website and I review websites that look a lot better than mine, and I just so happen to find Macbeth's blog.
Don't think too much into it. 

Anyway, not sure how you found this. But oh well, have fun I guess.
