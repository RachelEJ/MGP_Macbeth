                    <p id="mgpdesc">Hey guys, so I was looking around the Internet for some stuff to do for my MGP when I found this weird website. It's some kind of blog written by this crazy guy, and I think he might've killed someone. Here's a link so you can check it out for yourself.</p>

                    <h3 class="bd">Introduction</h3>
                       
                        <p class="intro"><em>The General’s Journal</em> is unique in this list for several reasons, the first being that
                        it was created and hosted on Wix.com as opposed to using HTML and CSS for building it and being hosted on another site. 
                        It is meant to answer the hypothetical question of “What if Macbeth had a blog?” while also reproducing my perception of
                        Macbeth’s state of mind throughout the course of the play. Overall, William Shakespeare’s <em>Macbeth</em> is a tragedy
                        capitalizing on the effects of ambition on a generally good-natured man and how it gives way to his descent into darkness
                        and eventual destruction. It begins with Macbeth, a general and war hero of Scotland, being told by three witches that he
                        is to become king. Elated at this news, Macbeth tells his wife, who convinces him to kill his king to obtain the crown.
                        After murdering his king in cold blood, Macbeth falls into corruption, leading him to kill more and more people just to
                        maintain what he believes to be his rightful place as king until he is finally brought to justice by Macduff. This
                        sequence of events is replicated in each blog post, but with a slight difference in that it tells what Macbeth wants the
                        public to believe rather than the reality of each event.</p>
                        
                        <p class="intro">The main blog is comprised of posts from Macbeth, each detailing his experiences and realizations. The
                        first of which is a post about preparing for the battle whose news of victory starts Act 1 Scene 2 of the original play,
                        recounting Macbeth’s readiness to claim victory and the suspicion of Norway’s intervention in the battle, hence the
                        Sergeant’s statement that Macbeth and Banquo weren’t scared in the slightest. It then begins recounting the events of the
                        play, referencing specific quotes and utilizing a realistic timeline, taking into account Shakespeare’s rendition of Duncan
                        compared to the historical as well as the actual times it would take for messages to be relayed from place to place. The
                        basis of this timeline is <em>A Time Analysis of the Plots of Shakespeare’s Plays</em> by P.A. Daniel but includes some liberties I
                        took to make the time frames seem more meaningful as well as to rejoin with the true course of history. As the blog
                        progresses, Macbeth tries to play the part of a victim and loyal subject, but slowly loses his credibility due to his
                        strange ramblings (showing his mental instability in the fact that a normal person wouldn’t include said ramblings in a
                        professional blog post) and the inclusion of details he wouldn’t know about if he were as innocent as he insists. A few
                        moments of his clarity exist in two poems, both referencing his realization of his crimes and temptations, to reveal that
                        some part of Macbeth struggles with the guilt and shame of afflicting Scotland with such pain only to receive nothing in
                        the end. A second website is linked in a blog post in order to incorporate a news article without breaking the character of
                        Macbeth and the initial blog. It provides a neutral account of Duncan’s murder and allows Macbeth to remain silent to prevent
                        self-incrimination. This, as mentioned before, is slowly undone as Macbeth descends into evil and destruction.</p>
                       
                        <p class="intro">All in all, I hope you enjoy this website as much as I have (especially in the smaller details I thought
                        were somewhat humorous). It is important to note, however, that though the majority of my MGP is hosted in <em>The General’s
                        Journal</em>, the container is not a single website. Instead, my container is the Internet and this small corner of it that I’ve
                        dedicated to this MGP and Shakespeare’s <em>Macbeth</em>. I chose this as my container because it would be the easiest for me to
                        design and implement my ideas while also keeping a versatile transition between each element. Please note that there is no
                        mobile version for the websites, so a desktop or laptop should be used for the best possible experience. Oh, and have fun
                        exploring a brighter, yet more deceiving, retelling of William Shakespeare’s tragedy of <em>Macbeth</em>.</p>

            <h3 class="bd">The Breakdown (Author's Notes)</h3>
                <p class="bdesc">The website consists of several parts:</p>
                    <ul id="mlist">
                        <li class="mheader">Extra - Timeline
                            <p class="mdesc">Now, I understand that the timeline is not an actual genre for my MGP,
                            but I do consider it an important aspect of my whole project. The timeline is altered
                            from real life due to Shakespeare’s portrayal of King Duncan as old and wise, instead of
                            the more historically accurate description of young and inexperienced. Given that Duncan
                            is estimated to have been born in 1001 and killed on August 14, 1040, he was most likely
                            39 years old. For him to be a bit older to match Shakespeare’s characterization of him, I
                            took the liberty to set the first blog post in 1056, giving him the more mature age of 55.
                            This divergence from history fits rather well with the common idea that the events of
                            <em>Macbeth</em> only lasted over the course of a year, thus fitting with Macbeth’s historical
                            death on August 15, 1057, one year and one day after his betrayal of Duncan. Aside from
                            the larger details such as death dates and whatnot, I also used P.A. Daniel’s time
                            analysis to include the time skips between rides to and from locations, messages sent
                            among the characters, and other hints as to the time passed between different scenes.
                            This timeline, though very different from real life, is as realistic as I could possibly
                            make it while also adhering to history and the inescapable nature of fate.

                        <li class="mheader">Genre 1: Blog Posts
                            <p class="mdesc">With that out of the way, next up for discussion is my first genre, a blog.
                            This genre is fundamentally different from most others due to the fact that it is composed
                            of many smaller posts and covers a larger span of time rather than a single event or object
                            from my independent reading. The reason I chose a blog format for my MGP genre is that I
                            initially had the idea to make an Internet version of <em>Macbeth</em> due to my familiarity with
                            websites and narrative writing. Thinking along that track, I noticed that the year
                            represented in the play could be replicated in a blog with dates for each upload. As stated
                            before, the blog uses Macbeth’s perspective to tell his side of the story while also focusing
                            only on what Macbeth wants people to believe about each event rather than what actually
                            happened. Because of this, the narrative told by each post is delivered by an unreliable
                            narrator, which is especially noticeable in Macbeth’s reactions to his allies’ murders and his
                            fears of succumbing to evil. I also used the play as a reference while writing each post to
                            include specific details and quotes from different characters to retain the Shakespeare feel
                            in some of the words. Please note that the posts are arranged from newest to oldest to
                            replicate an actual stream on a website. Running from the day before the battle against Norway
                            and the rebels and ending before the battle against Macduff, the blog tells the tale of a
                            valiant hero struggling against fate to retain his sense of honor and glory before falling
                            into nothingness.</p>

                        <li class="mheader">Genre 2: Poem/Haiku
                            <p class="mdesc">Posted on August 14, 1056 is a haiku written about Macbeth’s immediate feelings
                            after murdering Duncan. It’s composed of two haiku, of course using the 5-7-5 syllable pattern as
                            per the usual haiku format. The first haiku is about Macbeth’s guilt about what he’s had to do to
                            achieve his goal of becoming king. The second haiku is about Macbeth’s realization that he’s fallen
                            from grace due to his attraction to ideals rather than reality. The first line describes the three
                            sisters’ prophecy that Macbeth would soon become king, followed by his fear of betrayal, and
                            finally his actual betrayal of an innocent man. The fourth line introduces Macbeth’s revelation that
                            his wife has tempted him into treachery, references the knives that guided Macbeth to Duncan, and
                            the darkness that now envelopes him following his sin. I wrote a haiku because I had initially wanted
                            to write a poem about the three witches, but couldn’t make any headway. I then had the idea of
                            writing a haiku, which then developed into two about related topics. I set the posted date to August
                            14, 1056 to match the day that Duncan died in my version of the play. In my narrative, Macbeth
                            immediately felt remorse for his actions and wrote this haiku as a form of catharsis, but accidentally
                            posted it due to the onset of madness.</p>

                        <li class="mheader">Genre 3: News Article
                            <p class="mdesc">The day after Duncan’s death, Macbeth posts an update for his followers that something
                            terrible has happened. He briefly states what happened and expresses extreme sorrow at his kind lord’s
                            murder. He then includes a link to a news article, which acts as my third genre for my MPG. I wanted to
                            write a news article of some sort to describe an event of the play because many of the events seem like
                            they’d be newsworthy for 11th Century Scotland, giving me the perfect setup for this genre. Having
                            Macbeth post a link to it instead of describing Duncan’s murder himself is also the perfect transition
                            into my third genre because it provides Macbeth with a way to avoid outing himself but also keeps him
                            emotionally detached from the incident. Similarly detached, the article tells readers about the murder
                            of Duncan from a third-person perspective. It covers key details (such as who owns the castle, who found

                                called <em>The Scot</em>. <em>The Scot</em> is a shell of a news website, with only one functional page

                            <p class="mdesc">My fourth genre is that of a poem, a rather unorthodox poem because it uses a more uncommon
                            meter and mimics a sonnet without actually being a sonnet. Fourteen lines with three quatrains are used
                            alongside an ABAB CDCD EFEF GG rhyming scheme, making it resemble a Shakespearean sonnet, but it uses a more
                            choriambic-esque meter. Ten syllables are in each line with the first, fourth, seventh, and tenth syllables
                            stressed and the two between each pair unstressed. The poem itself is meant to describe ambition without
                            mentioning it by name, hence the name. This poem stemmed off my original idea to write a poem but ended with a
                            very different topic than I had initially planned. It was inspired by a section in <em>The Grace of Kings</em>
                            by Ken Liu, in which Mata Zyndu sings a song describing himself as a chrysanthemum, his family’s symbol, without
                            saying it by name. This part was inspired by a real poem written by Huang Chao after repeatedly failing the imperial
                            examinations. He then took up arms against the Tang Dynasty, striking a powerful blow that caused it to slowly
                            collapse under its martial weight. </p>
                            
                            <p class="mdesc">The first quatrain describes how ambition can affect anyone if gone unchecked, giving rise to
                            the blind pursuit of some dream without realizing its effects on life and relationships. The second quatrain
                            focuses on the rewards promised by overwhelming ambition, the stars and riches that delude a person into
                            believing that whatever prize they obtain at the end justifies whatever actions and decisions they had to make
                            along the way. In the end, mindlessly following some unrealistic dream leads to wasting time with little to no
                            reward. The third quatrain begins listing the consequences of extreme ambition. These can include mental
                            meltdowns and damaged self-esteem due to unrealistic expectations or completely withering someone’s interest in
                            something they truly enjoy. In extremes, it can result in one losing control to rage, burning everyone and
                            everything before fizzling out entirely. The final two lines describe the short life cycle of a rose, pricking
                            all who get too close before waning like a sunset to leave nothing. As a whole, the poem describes Macbeth,
                            picking up his ambitious delusions of becoming king, focusing only on the end rather than his actions, 
                            incinerating everyone around him, and dying without any good word left to his name.
